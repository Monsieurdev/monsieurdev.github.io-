<p>There are two important properties when it comes to position html elements on a web page, they are display inline and display inline block. But first, let's talk about Display inline. What this property does is it arranges elements on the same line, those typical elements can be paragraphs, unordered list or ordered list, and headings. In Mark up Language these would consist of the p, ul/ol, and h tags. Now the thing with this type of display is, elements don't necessarily keep their original format, meaning they will automaticaly change to fit accordingly if needed. for instance; imagine you have a horizontal space that could only takes three people with average built, and you have four people all huge and muscular. Good thing you have a super power that changes people's size, and Boom! you put in action so everyboy can fit in the space next to each other.The point here is to show that your super power is our display inline in HTML, and we use on html elements not people. Bellow is an illustration of display inline.</p></section>

<p>Now that we have talked about display inline, the concept about display inline block should be very straight forward because they are almost do the same thing which is to display elements on the same line. However, the difference is that with display inline block, elements are put on the same line as blocks, they do not change shape in the process, but you could do so with other html properties after setting your display inline block. The pics bellow show a display inline block case.</p>
