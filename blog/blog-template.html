How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was a fun experience, we checked out different tools and chose which one was best for us. And then we created different wireframes and compare them and offering suggestions to each other; from there we went on to create our page referring to the wireframes. 

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Yeah definitely, because it gives you a prototype that will make planning and developing much easier, it is a good practice. 

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
Our approach was to layout everything to reflect how our blog will look like; we also decided to keep it very basic and simple so we can learn a solid foundation of the process without worrying about complex stuff.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
I learned about few semantic elements such as: the section tags, nav tags, header tags, footer tags etc. since I plan to change my template later, I will to explore more of them.
