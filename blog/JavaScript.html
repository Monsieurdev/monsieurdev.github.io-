<p>If you are a Ruby programmer, and decide to start learning JavaScript, you’ll see a lot of similarities, among them Objects and hashes are great examples to showcase these similarities. However they do differ in many ways too. So without further due let’s illustrate.</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>First thing first off, both Hashes and Objects are created using curly braces:</p>
</section>
<pre>
hash ={}            object = {};
</pre>
<section>
<p>
In the example above, both the hash and the Object are empty. In Ruby, hashes are composed of key value pairs, they are two main notations for key/value pairs, we have the rocket notation “=>” and the symbol notation with a colon “:” behold:
</p>
</section>
<pre>
hash = {
	'name'=> 'John',
	:job => 'lawyer'
}
</pre>
<section>
<p>We also have key/value situation with Objects, but they are just referred as properties, so Objects contain properties and their values. Unlike hashes, Objects don’t have the rocket notation; they only operate with the colon notation, and the properties cannot be symbols like in Ruby:</p>
</section>
<pre>
object = {
	name : 'John',
	job : 'lawyer'
};

</pre>
<section>
<p>With hashes, you can only access keys using the bracket notation:</p>
</section>
<pre>
	hash = {
	'name'=> 'John',
	:job => 'lawyer'
}

puts hash['name']  #=> John
</pre>
<section>
<p>JavaScript gives two options, you could either use the bracket notation or the dot notation. Isn’t that awesome?</p>
</section>
<pre>
	object = {
	name : 'John',
	job : 'lawyer'
};

console.log(object.name); #=> john
console.log(object['job']); #=> lawyer
</pre>
<section>
<p>Another similarity is, the nested principle applies to both. You can have hashes inside a hash as you can have objects inside an Object, you can also have arrays inside them:
</p>
<pre>
hash = {                                     
	'name'=> 'john',
	:job => 'lawyer',
	'wife' => {'name' => 'Lisa'},            
	'kids' => ['Mary', 'Steve']
}

object = {
	name : 'john',
	job : 'lawyer',
	wife : {'name' : 'Lisa'},
	kids : ['Mary', 'Steve']
};

</pre>
