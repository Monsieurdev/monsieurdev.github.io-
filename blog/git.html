<p>Growing up, I have seen in movies some characters who play computer geeks typing some code in a dark screen type of thing. I always wondered what that was, why is he or her not just using a user interface just like the rest of us? Oh maybe you need some very special knowledge to be able to use that dark screen, will be I able to use it too one day? I have long struggle with these questions, I never really bothered to ask around because most of people in my daily life were just mere users like myself. When I finally started college with the intent to study computer science, I got some answers but they were not clear and satisfying, and in college they sometimes make you feel like you need a Bill Gate's brain model to really figure out these things, oh well may be I am exaggerating but I hope you do get the point. Fast forward this week I started DBC phase 0, and I can proudly say I got the best answers possible. It turns out the dark screen is a computer terminal powered with a shell, a shell is a command line interface (CLI) that takes commands from a user and executes them. In other words, it is like the interpreter between a user and a computer. There are other types of CLIs as well. Getting my answers was great but the best was that I got to play with the dark screen; by the way you can change the screen color to other colors in your terminal settings. In short, a terminal's background can be many other colors. I also learned that programming in shell is called shell scripting. I learned about few commands, I came to realize that you don't have to be incredibly smart to play with these stuff, anybody can! Most of the commands are pretty straight forward because sometimes a little guessing would tells you what a particular command does as a result you wouldn't even have to memorize it. For instance; if you see a command like "mkdir" and you were told to make a directory with that command, after you just notice the command is just a short cut of the intended task, it's nothing magical as I use to think. We have so many other commands like that such as: "rm" for remove, "cd" to change directory, "popd" to pop a directory etc.
In addition to the great stuff I learned about CLI, I have also been introduced to version control, git, and GitHub.</p></section>

<p>What is version control? You can think of it as a way for developers to keep track of changes made to their projects. These projects are often distributable, meaning other developers can make their own copy and do modifications as it pleases them. Version control is very beneficial to programmers because there is no worry about someone messing with the codes, they can always go to back to any changes made, and these changes are available to the others as well. All these good stuff are possible because of git which is a wonderful software that gives that time traveling power to a repository which is a place where codes are kept, in your computer you can turn any folder into a repository with git, that's done in the command line by typing the following command "git init" inside the folder you intend to make a repository. Making a repo is even easier and faster on GitHub and you can clone it on your computer. GitHub is a remote service (cloud) where we store repositories. Developers use GitHub because on of the reasons is they want to keep their code safe, so if your machine is damaged or stolen, you can still get your work from GitHub, and another reason is that you can access your codes anywhere in the world, they also use it because they want others to contribute to their projects like working in team. This was in short what I had to say about the start of this journey, I am pretty sure there are plenty learning experience on the way. I can't wait to tell you more I hope you learned something from this.
